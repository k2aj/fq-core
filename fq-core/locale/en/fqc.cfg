[mod-setting-description]
fqc-max-motion-step-distance=Affects motion caused by weapon recoil.\n\nLower values make the motion more smooth, but increase UPS cost.\n\nHigher values reduce UPS cost, but make the motion less smooth and may cause glitching through walls during recoil.
fqc-enable-crash-damage=Entities moving at fast speeds due to recoil will take crash damage if their motion is abruptly stopped.
fqc-max-safe-motion-speed=Entities travelling below this speed will not take any crash damage.
